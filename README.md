# Deep-Learning-Project-Plant-Pest-Detection

The motivation of this project is to
provide a solution to the ever-increasing pests in
plants and various crops that contribute to millions
of plants and crops being left diseased leading to
resource wastage every year. This project would
help houseplant enthusiasts who have their kitchen
gardens at home, as well as farmers to detect pests
even at the early onset of any kind of plant disease
and result in the optimum usage of their precious
resources such as water, fertilizers, as well as the
time spent in the fields doing hard work for months
and improve overall agricultural productivity. The
project uses DCNN, Resnet50, Alexnet, and VGG
and compares the best accuracy results for the most
favorable outcomes. The dataset used is a refined
version of the plant village dataset. Alexnet is the
best model with an accuracy of around 97% on the
training dataset while the other models have
around 90%.

A substantial portion of Indiaâ€™s agricultural land is
suffering from soil degradation, including soil erosion,
nutrient depletion and loss of organic matter. The root
cause of this issue lies in the imbalanced fertilizer use,
and other intensive farming practices to maximize
profits. The farming industry is no longer a food-
producing but merely a chemical industry. In this
condition, if we can detect pests from the early onset,
then a lot of unnecessary chemical usage can be
prevented. By implementing weekly drone checks with 
the camera having the plant pest detection algorithms,
a lot of problems in the field can be prevented.
